In this directory you can place Extensions for Virtual Reality

Each Extension should be in it's own tree and the root of the tree
should contain a file named "prebuild.xml", which will be included in the
main prebuild file.

The prebuild.xml should only contain <Project> and associated child tags.  
The <?xml>, <Prebuild>, <Solution> and <Configuration> tags should not be 
included since the Extentions prebuild.xml will be inserted directly into the main prebuild.xml
